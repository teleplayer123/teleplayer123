### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working with WiFi 7 and debugging/testing compatability and performance with many different devices. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about pentesting hardware and firmware for bugs/malware, specifically networking devices. In parallel I am working on some Machine Learning projects integrating microcontrolers like RP2040 and SAMD51.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Please reach out to me on my Linkedin page https://www.linkedin.com/in/cole-sashkin-44663456/, or create an issue on this repository. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: The "tele" in my username "teleplayer123" is short for "Telecaster". I have played guitar since I was 12 years old.


# My Skills
My strongest programming language is Python. I have professional experience in both Linux and Windows operating systems,
such as creating wireless sniffers with a linux, debugging/collecting driver and kernel logs, and programming in C# with native Windows APIs.
I have experience with assembly languages: x86, x86_64, arm, as well as debugging/reverse engineering C code with GDB,
as can be seen in my projects: [ROP Format Exploit](https://github.com/teleplayer123/ROP-Format-Exploit)
and [x86_64 Simple Buffer Overflow](https://github.com/teleplayer123/x86_64-Simple-BOF).
Similarly, I have Penetration Testing skills in exploiting vulnerabilities in C code on both 
Linux ans Window's OS. In addition, I am knowledgeable in computer Networking, with a strong understanding of
network protocols and the OSI model, as well as network packet construction as can be seen in my 
project [Packet Analysis](https://github.com/teleplayer123/packet_analysis_v1.2). I have professional experience with Wired and 
Wireless network architecture and automating throughput testing for single and multi-client test cases. I have experience
working with popular network throuput testing software such as Iperf and Ixia Chariot. Another programming language I am 
comfortable with is C#. An example can be seen in my project [ProcessManager](https://github.com/teleplayer123/ProcessManager).
My hardware experience consists of flashing builds development boards with JLink as well as serial connections such as UART, and SWD. I have hands on
experience with [serial protocols](https://github.com/teleplayer123/SerialComTools) such as I2C, SPI, and UART. As a hobby I like to experiment
with development boards and reading data off of flash chips found on old unused hardware. I also enjoy disassembling files for security
and malware analysis. My project [PEDisassembler](https://github.com/teleplayer123/PE_Disassembler) for extracting headers from PE files is
an ongoing personal project I enjoy working on, as it pushes me to learn more about file formats.
My knowledge of previously mentioned protocols enhance my ability to comprehend software and 
hardware logs to pinpoint areas of importance to find and fix issues/bugs. In my professional carrer I have used Atlassian development tools,
such as JIRA, and experience in the Agile approach for developing software.
