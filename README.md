### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing my technical skill set as a programmer and test technician. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning programming as it pertains to hardware development.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for opportunities to furthur my knowledge of technology and programming.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Please reach out to me on my Linkedin page https://www.linkedin.com/in/cole-sashkin-44663456/, or create an issue on this repository. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: The "tele" in my username "teleplayer123" is short for "Telecaster". I have played guitar since I was 12 years old.

My Goals:
----
My goal is to keep moving my way up in the Tech world, and solidify my career in the field as a Software Developer/QA Technician/IT specialist.

My Professional History
----
I was so lucky to get a chance to work for Novus Labs. I learned so much, and gained many new skills.
In my job as a Quality Assurance Technician, I went above and beyond to learn and contribute as much as possible.
On the job I learned how to crimp my own ethernet cords and work with an array of widely know development boards such as: EFR32, NRF52, and STM32.
The majority of my job consisted of debugging and testing sophisticated software for well know companies, and file bug reports using Atlassian development tools 
like JIRA, with complete sets of hardware, software level, and network level logs using automation I wrote to ensure preciseness and accuracy. 
I wrote software to automate the majority of tests that were executed on the DUT(device under test) to ensure and facilitate proper communication
between Central and Peripheral devices. I have a lot of experience with the Linux command line and many of the widely used GUI and CLI's that have become an 
industry standard for a lot of companies. Here is a non-exhaustive list of some of the one's I used most frequently: adb and logcat, fastboot, wireshark, tcpdump,
nmap, net-tools, and iperf. Some other linux commands and protocols that I used are: ssh, sftp, dmesg, lsusb, grep, tar, and many others.

# My Skills
My strongest programming language is Python. I am very well versed in both Linux and Windows operating systems,
and have a solid foundation in troubleshooting and securing both Linux and Windows OS. I also
have a good understanding of Assembly Language, and debugging/reverse engineering C code with GDB,
as can be seen in my projects: [ROP Format Exploit](https://github.com/teleplayer123/ROP-Format-Exploit)
and [x86_64 Simple Buffer Overflow](https://github.com/teleplayer123/x86_64-Simple-BOF).
Similarly, I have Penetration Testing skills in exploiting vulnerabilities in C code on both 
Linux ans Window's OS. In addition, I am knowledgeable in computer Networking, with a strong understanding of
network protocols and the OSI model, as well as network packet construction as can be seen in my 
project [Packet Analysis](https://github.com/teleplayer123/packet_analysis_v1.2). My knowledge of hardware 
consists of flashing builds development boards over JLink as well a UART, and SWD. Similarly I have hands on
experience with [serial protocols](https://github.com/teleplayer123/SerialComTools) such as I2C, SPI, and UART as well as professional experience with debugging and
interfacing with Bluetooth and BLE. My knowledge of these protocols enhance my ability to comprehend software and 
hardware logs to pinpoint areas of importance to find and fix issues/bugs. I have experience with Atlassian development tools,
such as JIRA, and using the Agile approach for developing software.
