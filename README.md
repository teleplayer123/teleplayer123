### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on security related programming and studying for CompTIA Security+ exam.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning powershell scripting with WQL as it pertains to Windows security and IT.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any security related project and/or any project I can contribute to.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ways to get started in an IT Security career field. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: you can reach out to me on twitter, @colesashkin. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: The "tele" in my username "teleplayer123" is short for "Telecaster". Before I put all my focus on
               learning programming and IT Security, I'd spend all my time playing guitar. 

My Goals:
----
I study cyber security with the goal of starting a carrer in a related field. Ultimately,
I would like to help people secure their private information, and defend against the
constant threats that come with living in an world of advanced technology.
