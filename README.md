My Goals:
----
My goal is to keep moving my way up in the Tech world, and solidify my career in the field as a Software Developer/QA Technician/IT specialist.

# My Skills
My strongest programming language is Python. I am very well versed in both Linux and Windows operating systems,
and have a solid foundation in troubleshooting and securing both Linux and Windows OS. I also
have a good understanding of Assembly Language, and debugging/reverse engineering C code with GDB,
as can be seen in my projects: [ROP Format Exploit](https://github.com/teleplayer123/ROP-Format-Exploit)
and [x86_64 Simple Buffer Overflow](https://github.com/teleplayer123/x86_64-Simple-BOF).
Similarly, I have Penetration Testing skills in exploiting vulnerabilities in C code on both 
Linux ans Window's OS. In addition, I am knowledgeable in computer Networking, with a strong understanding of
network protocols and the OSI model, as well as network packet construction as can be seen in my 
project [Packet Analysis](https://github.com/teleplayer123/packet_analysis_v1.2). My knowledge of hardware 
consists of flashing builds development boards over JLink as well a UART, and SWD. Similarly I have hands on
experience with [serial protocols](https://github.com/teleplayer123/SerialComTools) such as I2C, SPI, and UART as well as professional experience with debugging and
interfacing with Bluetooth and BLE. My knowledge of these protocols enhance my ability to comprehend software and 
hardware logs to pinpoint areas of importance to find and fix issues/bugs. I have experience with Atlassian development tools,
such as JIRA, and knowledge of the Agile approach for developing software.
