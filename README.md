### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working with WiFi 7 and debugging/testing compatability and performance with many different devices. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about pentesting hardware and firmware for bugs/malware, specifically networking devices. In parallel I am working on some Machine Learning projects integrating microcontrolers like RP2040 and SAMD51.
- 📫 How to reach me: Please reach out to me on my Linkedin page https://www.linkedin.com/in/cole-sashkin-44663456/, or create an issue on this repository. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: The "tele" in my username "teleplayer123" is short for "Telecaster". I have played guitar since I was 12 years old.


# My Skills
My strongest programming language is Python, and I have experience with other languages such as Rust, C#, and C. 
I have professional experience in both Linux and Windows operating systems,
including creating wireless sniffers on linux, debugging/collecting driver and kernel logs, and programming with native Windows APIs.
I have worked with assembly languages x86, x86_64, and ARM for binary analysis as well as debugging/reverse engineering C code with GDB,
as can be seen in my projects: [ROP Format Exploit](https://github.com/teleplayer123/ROP-Format-Exploit)
and [x86_64 Simple Buffer Overflow](https://github.com/teleplayer123/x86_64-Simple-BOF).
In addition, I am knowledgeable in computer Networking, with a strong understanding of
network protocols and the OSI model, as well as network packet construction as can be seen in my 
project [Packet Analysis](https://github.com/teleplayer123/packet_analysis_v1.2). I have professional experience with Wired and 
Wireless network architecture and automating throughput testing for single and multi-client test cases with popular network throuput testing software such as Iperf and Ixia Chariot.
I like working with hardware and software, as well as creating tools for debugging and analysis interesting IC's and protocols like USB C PD: [USB C PD Debugger](https://github.com/teleplayer123/usbc_pd_devboard).
I also enjoy disassembling files for security and malware analysis: [File Analysis](https://github.com/teleplayer123/FileAnalysis),
