### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Machine Learning projects, like [Bitcoinforecast](https://github.com/teleplayer123/BitcoinForecast). I am also working on a project called [weather-widget](https://github.com/sguthals/buildwithdrg/tree/main/weather-widget) with the amazing and inspirational [Dr. Sarah Guthals](https://github.com/sguthals).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to build and work with CI/CD pipelines, and continuing my studies in Machine Learning, and Windows/Linux troubleshooting, configuration, and security.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any project or assignment I can be of help on. 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ways to start a career in a technical field such as IT related jobs, Software Engineer, Software Development, etc. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: you can reach out to me on twitter, @colesashkin, or create an issue on this repository. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: The "tele" in my username "teleplayer123" is short for "Telecaster". Before I put all my focus on
               learning programming and computer related skills, I'd spend all my time playing guitar. 

My Goals:
----
My long term goal is to work my way up to a career in cyber security. Ultimately,
I would like to help people secure their private information, and defend against the
constant threats that come with living in an world of advanced technology. 
My current goal is to start a career in a computer technology field. I am looking for opportunities
to start in an IT job position, or in a computer programming related position, such as software engineering.
I am opening to any and all opportunities to advance my technical skills in my pursuit of a career in
a computer technology field. 

# My Skills
My strongest programming language is Python. I also have a good understanding of JavaScript,
as well as HTML. I am very well versed in both Linux and Windows operating systems,
and have a solid foundation in troubleshooting and securing both Linux and Windows OS. I also
have a good understanding of Assembly Language, and debugging/reverse engineering C code with GDB,
as can be seen in my projects: [ROP Format Exploit](https://github.com/teleplayer123/ROP-Format-Exploit)
and [x86_64 Simple Buffer Overflow](https://github.com/teleplayer123/x86_64-Simple-BOF).
Similarly, I have Penetration Testing skills in exploiting vulnerabilities in C code on both 
Linux ans Window's OS. In addition, I am knowledgeable in computer Networking, with a strong understanding of
network protocols and the OSI model, as well as network packet construction as can be seen in my 
project [Packet Analysis](https://github.com/teleplayer123/packet_analysis_v1.2).
