### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing my technical skill set as a programmer and test technician. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning programming as it pertains to hardware development.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for opportunities to furthur my knowledge of technology and programming.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Please reach out to me on my Linkedin page https://www.linkedin.com/in/cole-sashkin-44663456/, or create an issue on this repository. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: The "tele" in my username "teleplayer123" is short for "Telecaster". I have played guitar since I was 12 years old.

My Goals:
----
My goal is to keep moving my way up in the Tech world, and solidify my career in the field.

My Professional History
----
I was so lucky to get a chance to work for Novus Labs. I learned so much, and gained many new skills.
Although my job was a Quality Assurance Technician, I went above and beyond to learn and contribute as much as possible.
On the job I learned how to Crimp my own Ethernet cords and work with an array of widely know development boards such as: EFR32, NRF52, and STM32.
The majority of my job was to debug and test sophisticated software for well know companies and file bug reports in an industry wide format 
with complete sets of logs using automation I wrote to ensure preciseness and accuracy. I wrote software to automate the majority of tests
that were executed on the DUT(device under test) to ensure and facilitate proper communication between Central and Peripheral devices.
I have a lot of experience with the Linux command line and many of the widely used CLI's that have become an industry standard for a lot of companies.


# My Skills
My strongest programming language is Python. I also have a good understanding of JavaScript,
as well as HTML. I am very well versed in both Linux and Windows operating systems,
and have a solid foundation in troubleshooting and securing both Linux and Windows OS. I also
have a good understanding of Assembly Language, and debugging/reverse engineering C code with GDB,
as can be seen in my projects: [ROP Format Exploit](https://github.com/teleplayer123/ROP-Format-Exploit)
and [x86_64 Simple Buffer Overflow](https://github.com/teleplayer123/x86_64-Simple-BOF).
Similarly, I have Penetration Testing skills in exploiting vulnerabilities in C code on both 
Linux ans Window's OS. In addition, I am knowledgeable in computer Networking, with a strong understanding of
network protocols and the OSI model, as well as network packet construction as can be seen in my 
project [Packet Analysis](https://github.com/teleplayer123/packet_analysis_v1.2).
