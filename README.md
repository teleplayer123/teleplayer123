- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on taking my technical skills and applying them towrads developing a employable skill set. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning DevOps, and continuing my studies in Machine Learning, and Windows/Linux troubleshooting, configuration, and security.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on DevOps projects and Machine Learning projects, as well as any other project I can be of use on. 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ways to start a career in a technical field such as IT related jobs, Software Engineer, Software Development, etc. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: you can reach out to me on twitter, @colesashkin, or create an issue on this repository. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: The "tele" in my username "teleplayer123" is short for "Telecaster". Before I put all my focus on
               learning programming and computer related skills, I'd spend all my time playing guitar. 

My Goals:
----
My long term goal is to work my way up to a career in cyber security. Ultimately,
I would like to help people secure their private information, and defend against the
constant threats that come with living in an world of advanced technology.
